# 10digits-Files-Renamer 



With this script you can rename all files in the current working directory with Random 10digits number filenames.

This Python script has been compiled as a executable file and works on Windows operating systems.
* There is a compiled .exe file you can copy and run it into the directory where you have the files you need to be renamed.



## AI Involvement

The script's development did not depend on AI tools like ChatGPT, their main use was for creating code comments and descriptions.
